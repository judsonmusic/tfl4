        <p><strong>What is my TFL Chart?:</strong> It is an interactive chart that will provide you a comprehensive overview of how you ranked yourself in all of the dimensions of your life that you have unlocked. Each bar on the chart is color coded and represents the following:
        </p>

        <ul style="margin-left: 50px; list-style: none;">
          <li>
            <div class="swatch swatch-blue"></div>
            How <strong class="blue">important</strong> the dimension is to you
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="swatch swatch-yellow"></div>
            How the dimension impacts your <strong class="yellow">happiness</strong></li>
          <li>
            <div class="swatch swatch-green"></div>
            How the dimension impacts your work <strong class="green">performance</strong></li>
          <li>
            <div class="swatch swatch-red"></div>
            How <strong class="red">satisfied</strong> you are with the dimension
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="swatch swatch-orange"></div>
            How <strong class="orange">actively</strong> you are working to improve and/or maintain the dimension
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="swatch swatch-light-blue"></div>
            How <strong class="light-blue">motivated</strong> you are to improve and/or maintain the dimension
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Your TFL Chart:</strong> Reflects how you responded to the above questions in your assessment and the bars populate your responses from a low of 20 to a high of 100. Your TFL Chart will only reflect data findings in the dimensions that you have unlocked.</p>

        <p><strong>How does my TFL chart work?:</strong> You can suppress and populate each bar on the chart by clicking and unclicking the words below the chart: <strong class="blue">Importance</strong>, <strong class="yellow">Happiness</strong>, <strong class="green">Performance</strong>, <strong class="red">Satisfaction</strong>, <strong class="orange">Action</strong>, and <strong class="light-blue">Motivation</strong>. This interactive view will allow you to compare and contrast each dimension you have unlocked in all 6 areas.</p>

        <p><strong>Your Ideal Being Score:</strong> Reflects how you ranked your level of satisfaction in each dimension.</p>
        <p><strong>Stress Gauge:</strong> Your <strong class="blue">stress</strong> gauge reflects the level of stress you feel associated with each dimension. 20% reflects low satisfaction and 100% reflects high satisfaction.</p>

        <p><strong>Your TFL Action Plan:</strong> Once each dimension is unlocked you will have access to dimension specific information, tools and resources designed to help you develop a TFL Action Plan to improve your level of satisfaction.</p>

        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> By recognizing what impacts your total Ideal Being you can begin to take action in the dimensions which are most important to you. Have fun reviewing your charts and TFL Action Plans and remember self-awareness is the first step towards personal empowerment.</p>

        <p><strong>Important to note:</strong> Your TFL Chart and Acton Plan will only reflect information in the dimensions that you have unlocked. Enjoy unlocking each dimension.</p>
