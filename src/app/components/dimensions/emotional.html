        <p>Take time to think about the following questions and perhaps answer them in a personal Ideal Being Journal that you can go back and reference and add to over time. We encourage you to share and discuss your answers with a coach, counselor or friend. You will be asked
            to answer the same seven questions for each dimension and we encourage you to take the time to do this self-reflective exercise. Your answers will give you greater clarity and a good foundation in which to begin your journey to a state of Ideal Being. </p>

            <li>What do you envision your life to look and feel like if you gain greater satisfaction in this dimension?</li>

        <p><strong>Self-awareness Exercises:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Accentuate the positive exercise:  Don’t wait until negative emotions wake you up to how you are feeling.  Be proactive to pause and connect when you are feeling emotions like joy, peace and happiness. Make it a point to sit down and connect to your thoughts and let what you are thinking move into your body and connect to what you are feeling. Sit still and notice things like your breath, heartrate, skin temperature and sensations in your body. Let the moment imprint on your mind and body and take an extra moment to be grateful. This exercise will help you build gratitude muscles so when life gets hard you will be better equipped to deal with its challenges. Consider staring a gratitude journal and record your positive experiences. Journaling helps rewire our thinking and can reinforce new positive behavior.
            </li>
            <li>
                Power in the pause exercise:  Life circumstances can trigger emotions like fear, anxiety and sadness.  These are all normal emotions, but the better equipped we are to handle them the better we can manage our emotions in a healthy manner.  It starts with awareness, so when you notice you are feeling anxious or overwhelmed, don’t disregard your emotions.  Stop what you are doing and sit down in order to connect to what is happening.  Give yourself a moment to gain your emotional equilibrium and take 10 slow deep breaths.  Connect to your thoughts and let what you are thinking move into your body and connect to what you are feeling.  Sit still and notice things like your breath, heartrate and skin temperature.   Just the exercise of slowing down, breathing and connecting to your body will help your emotions settle down. Once you have taken these steps try and detach from your emotional reaction and begin looking at the situation more carefully to better understand the root cause and why you have been emotionally triggered.  When we can pause, step back and become a witness to our own lives, we can often see things more clearly and objectively. Consider journaling if you encounter a situation that triggers you. It will help you make sense of your emotions, pinpoint patterns of behavior and gain clarity.  Research has shown that journaling helps reduce stress, improve problem solving and it can even improve your health.
            </li>
            <li> Define your feelings exercise: Give your feelings Defining your feelings is also important in managing emotions. One activity to help you reflect on your feelings and better understand them is to complete the following sentences:<br><br>
                <ol class="no-pad-left">
                    <li><div style="float: left; width: 300px">If this feeling was a color, it would be</div><div style="float: left; border-bottom: 1px solid #444; width: 100px; height: 17px;"></div></li>
                    <li><div style="float: left; width: 300px">If this feeling was weather, it would be</div><div style="float: left; border-bottom: 1px solid #444; width: 100px; height: 17px;"></div></li>
                    <li><div style="float: left; width: 300px">If this feeling was a landscape, it would be</div><div style="float: left; border-bottom: 1px solid #444; width: 100px; height: 17px;"></div></li>
                    <li><div style="float: left; width: 300px">If this feeling was music, it would sound like</div><div style="float: left; border-bottom: 1px solid #444; width: 100px; height: 17px;"></div></li>
                    <li><div style="float: left; width: 300px">If this feeling was an object, it would be</div><div style="float: left; border-bottom: 1px solid #444; width: 100px; height: 17px;"></div></li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>


        <p>These exercises help to sharpen your awareness, so you can notice even subtle signs of feelings. The earlier you can define an emotion, the sooner you can know how to handle it most effectively (1).</p>
        <p>Emotions are like a kaleidoscope, forever changing with new patterns of behavior, feelings and reactions.  Becoming more aware and awake to your feelings will allow you to take greater control of your life and your happiness.</p>

    <div class="panel-body panel-collapsed">
        <p>As humans, we experience an array of emotions, from happiness, to sadness to extreme joy and depression.  Different feelings are experienced within the body as a result of chemicals released specific to each emotion (1).  There is a direct connection between our
            bodies’ physical and emotional responses. When you have a pain or tightness in an area of your body, it may be related to something you are feeling emotionally (1).  Poor emotional health can weaken your body’s immune system, making you more likely to get colds and
            other infections during emotionally difficult times (2).  While the following symptoms can indicate the presence of other serious illnesses (and as such should be discussed with your health care provider), they can also be signs that your emotional health is out of
            balance:</p>

        <ol class="no-pad-left">
            <li>Back pain</li>
            <li>Change in appetite</li>
            <li>Chest pain</li>
            <li>Digestive issues</li>
            <li>Dry mouth</li>
            <li>Headaches</li>
            <li>Heart palpitations</li>
            <li>Lightheadedness</li>
            <li>Sexual problems</li>
            <li>Sleep issues</li>
            <li>Sweating</li>
            <li>Weight change</li>
        </ol>
        <p>People who are in good emotional health are aware of their thoughts, feelings and behaviors. They have learned healthy ways to cope with the stress and problems that are a normal part of life.  They feel good about themselves and have healthy relationships
            (2).&rdquo;<br/> Once you are conscious of your thought patterns and emotions, you can begin to see the relationship between emotional and physical pain. This gives you greater control over your body; physical conditions can improve or even go away once you are better
            attuned to them (1).<br/> Remember, the power to get through anything life throws at you lies within you (1).<br/></p>

        <p>Negative emotions, like rage, envy or bitterness, tend to spiral out of control, especially right after they&rsquo;ve been triggered.   Instead of simply reacting, slow things down and observe.  You will find you have the tools to process emotions and illness quickly
            when you see them for what they are and explore why they came up (1).&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Here are six steps to help control your emotions in a challenging situation (2):</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Don&rsquo;t react right away:</strong>  Take a deep breath.  Continue to breathe deeply for five minutes, noticing as your muscles become less tense and your heart rate returns to normal.  As you become calmer, affirm to yourself that this is only temporary.&nbsp;<br/>
            <strong>Ask for divine guidance:</strong>&nbsp; Faith is our saving grace in our darkest moments.  No matter your creed, when burdened with emotion, close your eyes, envision a positive solution to your problem, and ask the universe to illuminate the best path
            forward.<br/> <strong>Find a healthy outlet:</strong>&nbsp; Call or go see someone you trust and recount to them what happened.  Engage in journaling, meditation, exercise or another healing activity.<br/> <strong>See the bigger picture:</strong>  Even in the midst of
            an emotionally upsetting moment, trust that there exists an ultimate purpose which you will come to comprehend soon.<br/> <strong>Replace your thoughts:</strong>  Whenever you are confronted with a negative emotion, force bad thoughts out of your mind and replace them
            with different ones.  Imagine the ideal resolution to your problem playing out; think about someone or something that makes you happy.<br/>
            <strong>Forgive your emotional triggers:  </strong>When you forgive someone who stirs negative emotions in you, you detach from
            resentment, jealousy or fury.<br/>
            <strong>Seek immediate professional help:</strong> If you are suffering from chronic stress, depression or anxiety and feel you are a danger to yourself or others.

        </p>
        <p>If you continue to suffer from the effects of emotional distress and feel overwhelmed by it, you should contact a professional.  Here are some red flags to look out for:</p>
        <ol class="no-pad-left">
            <li>Inability to sleep</li>
            <li>Feeling down, hopeless or helpless most of the time</li>
            <li>Problems with your ability to concentrate that are interfering with your work or home life</li>
            <li>Using alcohol, drugs, food or tobacco to cope with difficult emotions</li>
            <li>Negative or self-destructive thoughts or fears that you can't control*</li>
            <li>Thoughts of death or suicide*</li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>* Having self-destructive behavior or thoughts, especially suicidal ones, is a symptom that needs immediate attention.  If you experience such feelings and feel that you need help, contact EAP if your company provides this service or the National Suicide Prevention
